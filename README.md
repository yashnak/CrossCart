# **Cross Cart**

### **Provides a concise and convenient experience for when you're shopping for similar products over multiple websites.**


## **About**
**Cross Cart is a chrome extension that can help you compare multiple products across different retail sites.**

## **How it Works**
Navigate to the product page of any retail site and simply click on the Cross Cart icon in the Google Chrome toolbar. If not already present, enter the name of the particular item you are shopping for on the main popup screen using the "Add item" button.
